# Hi there, Iâ€™m Ifeanyi Benny! ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Data Analyst** and **Technical Writer** passionate about building impactful data solutions and sharing knowledge through engaging content.

Professionally, I am a Data Analyst at [Asset & Resource Management Holding Company (ARM HoldCo)](https://www.arm.com.ng) , collaborating with the Customer Experience (CX) and Product teams to help clients manage their wealth and invest in a brighter tomorrow.

In addition to my role at ARM HoldCo, I am a freelance writer for [Hit Subscribe](https://www.hitsubscribe.com/the-team/#writersandeditors), your one-stop shop for high-quality tech content marketing and [Hackmamba](https://hackmamba.io/), a technical content agency for SaaS companies.


> Before ARM? I focused on teaching data analysis and related tools, as well as building vibrant learning communities:
>
> - Educator and Consultant at [UrbizEdge](https://urbizedge.com/). I taught data analysis, the Power Platform, and Excel, while also managing our learning communities [Microsoft Excel and Data Analysis Learning Community](https://www.meetup.com/microsoft-excel-and-data-analysis-learning-community/?eventOrigin=event_home_page) and [Power BI Learning Community](https://www.meetup.com/power-bi-learning-community/?eventOrigin=event_home_page).
> - Instructor at [Resagratia](https://resagratia.com).  I previously taught data analysis and created courses, including the popular [Data analytics with Google sheet course](https://resagratia.com/course/data-analytics-fundamentals-with-google-sheets).


When Iâ€™m not analyzing data or writing technical content, I enjoy watching movies and anime, engaging in speaking opportunities, volunteering at communities or boot camps, and writing technical articles to share my knowledge.
