# Hi there, Iâ€™m Ifeanyi Benny! ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Data Analyst** and **Technical Writer**. I love to write, share knowledge, and build incredible data solutions. 

Professionally, I am a Data Analyst at [Asset & Resource Management Holding Company (ARM HoldCo)](https://www.arm.com.ng), where we help you manage your wealth and invest in your tomorrow. I also work as a freelancer writer at [Hit Subscribe](https://www.hitsubscribe.com/the-team/#writersandeditors), your one-stop shop for tech content marketing and [Hackmamba](https://hackmamba.io/), a technical content agency for SaaS companies.

Outside work, I watch movies and anime, have speaking engagments, volunteer at communities or boot camps, and write technical articles.
